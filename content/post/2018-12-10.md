> **Adam Gruer** (@AdamGruer; 2/0): @JenRichmondPhD from the R console you can try blogdown::update_hugo()  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1071918334172491776)

> **Jonathan C. Lau** (@jclau_ca; 1/0): @theaknowles @WesternU @xieyihui @LucyStats Just took a look: https://t.co/CbG6TXL9CO. They are still linking to the 2010 template. An up-to-date version would ideally be hosted on a repo managed by UWO. (Just in time to be replaced by bookdown!)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1071890625362939904)

> **Jonathan C. Lau** (@jclau_ca; 0/0): @theaknowles @WesternU @xieyihui @LucyStats Humbled to be mentioned here next to the work of @LucyStats &amp; @XieYihui. I literally just took an outdated latex template, made some minor mods, and shared on git. Unfortunately too late for me to adopt, but what you're building with R mark/bookdown is definitely the way forward!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1071879910128418816)

# knitr

> **Benjamin Wolfe** (@BenjaminWolfe; 0/0): @GuerfaliFatma Steep-ish learning curve, but maybe it's time to buckle down and learn it. 🤞 Recommendations for learning materials?

Also, suggestions for workflows / tools? Lyx + knitr?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1071975522706620418)
