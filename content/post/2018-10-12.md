# blogdown

> **Dmitry Shkolnik** (@dshkol; 1/0): @vinnythiv @oharascience Checkout blogdown and bookdown next for a couple of great applications of rmarkdown in production. My page is in rmarkdown, and I'm seeing more and more textbook and dissertations written in bookdown.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1050499296808722432)

Check it out for an introduction to #rstats data.table package. The material was originally presented at @RLadiesTC meetup.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1050581261440303104)

> **Ben Gonzalez** (@benmachiavelli8; 0/0): @xieyihui Okay, thanks for the reply. I had an eror I referenced on stackoverflow. I definitely see the benefits of blogdown.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1050506727358156802)

Obviously I'm very much in favor of blogdown now and don't see significant benefits of WordPress.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1050464243697500161)

Would it make sense to create an issue or even pull request on git for blogdown/knitr? It had quite an impact on my blogdown template, since .header was tailored at &lt;header&gt;...

> **Alex Lishinski** (@html034; 2/0): @ebovee09 @jrosenberg6432 You can always render your LaTeX as a pdf, then google pdf to word, and there's various websites that will do it easily. Of course, if you do it in bookdown like @jrosenberg6432 and I did, you can render as word, plus you mostly won't have to deal with the LaTeX directly.

# knitr

> **Dr. Em Jones** (@emjones; 2/0): I may be the only person in this ‘Intro to R’ workshop that is disappointed to learn the knitr package has little to do with knitting. #growthmindset #jhu  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1050416460898680832)

<!-- -->


> **Seth Axen** (@sdaxen; 2/0): So in summary, the workflow is: 1) create a synced notebook/Rmd 2) write and add citations in Rmd 3) do exploratory analysis in notebook 4) use knitr to convert to a variety of formats, including .tex, .pdf, .html, and .docx. Will be happy to write up with examples.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1050269864332382208)

> **Frank** (@fra_loe; 1/0): @rw_hass Sweave might be an option. You can add the output from R directly to LaTeX, eg via knitr. https://t.co/Ys6e9invxn You can build your Rnw file using LaTeX templates. Worked flawless for my thesis and (one) paper (so far).

> **Thomas Lin Pedersen** (@thomasp85; 1/0): @KJSint @xieyihui FWIW the animate package (the latex one) supports this with the poster argument, so knitr should be able to add this...  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1050490490058170370)

# xaringan
