# blogdown

> **Laura Aci√≥n** (@_lacion_; 2/0): @WeAreRLadies @lara_hogan I created my webpage using blogdown! üéâ  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1058487378489368577)

> **üåç Phil** (@philmikejones; 1/0): @WeAreRLadies Thanks, I'd be interested to hear what differences you find. I've only ever used blogdown/hugo, but it's always helpful to know about alternatives for future projects!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1058387598752780289)

To be precise it #rstats #blogdown but it is not necessary to use R for static sites if you don't need to render code.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1058244184639922177)

> **üåç Phil** (@philmikejones; 0/0): @WeAreRLadies What's the difference between Radix and Hugo/blogdown?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1058255042434654209)

> **We are R-Ladies** (@WeAreRLadies; 0/0): @philmikejones I don't have a good answer for this beyond pointing you here: https://t.co/O1UNdWE6v5 Since this question has come up a lot, I'm thinking about switching my blog setup from blogdown to Radix and writing up what I see as pros/cons, similarities/differences. I'll keep you posted.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1058375663416012801)

> **Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 0/0): @ma_salmon @travisci @Netlify I will look- tl;dr all is working but I get two deploys for every github push- the first fails b/c the bookdown files are not built yet in the github repo, the second works b/c Travis built them. Do you guys have this problem?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1058382554972057600)

# knitr

> **Matt Johnson üö©** (@mrjoh3; 2/1): @jtrnyc a recent update to #knitr or #rmarkdown included a function to automatically look for #webshot. If installed any html content will be converted to png. This means you can render pdf or html without changing your .Rmd file. #rstats to the rescue :) https://t.co/vPUvzniOH0  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1058554012402761728)
