> **Melina Vidoni** (@melvidoni; 2/0): @_lacion_ @apreshill Thanks!! üéâüéâ But I'm sure my problem here is Windows. I was able to install the #blogdown with no issues on Linux, but it gives me weird errors on Windows. Need to spend more time on it, for sure. Hopefully this weekend!

> **Maxwell Joseph üç©** (@mxwlj; 1/0): @jsonbaik I am not sure - started writing it in LaTeX, then moved to sweave, then to Rmd, which brought me to blogdown, but then I realized it would be a good book so I went to bookdown, but then I figured why not a gitbook, but then I went to Binder for interactivity. So maybe 6 months?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1060958319425183746)

I'll give it a shot again at a more decent hour üòÖü§£  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1060900490932822016)

> **Malcolm Barrett ü¶É+üë®‚Äçüé§** (@malco_barrett; 1/1): @ssjac79 It's really a treat! R4DS has a nice chapter on it (https://t.co/7E3ttQxxO6) and @DataCamp has a good intro course (https://t.co/cqk2n5q2iB). If you want a deeper, dive, there's also the new R Markdown book (https://t.co/44fPpZ2vY4). I haven't read it yet, but it looks great!

I print off handouts with code names for each dataset, but you could instead color-code them. So for recipe 1 for example, the dataset was called "HOT CROSS BUNS" ü•ê
