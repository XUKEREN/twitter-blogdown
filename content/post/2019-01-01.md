> **andrew mcc** (@wouldeye125; 1/0): It seems that every #rstats New Year‚Äôs resolution post I see mentions #blogdown. Do they find the manuals and guides on the topic to be insufficient like I do? What can we as a community do to make blogdown easier?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1079905671062192128)

Otherwise: GitHub for all kinds of files, slideshare for presentations, or figshare?

> **Malcolm Barrett ü¶Åüêª** (@malco_barrett; 13/0): The first is one was a last minute treat, R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by @xieyihui et al. I thought it would be a quick review and maybe I'd learn a few tricks. Underestimation. I learned a TON. üëç even if you have lots of experience with R Markdown.  https://t.co/44fPpZ2vY4  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1079848547887939584)

> **Thea Knowles** (@theaknowles; 2/0): Turned all my notes into a tidy little #bookdown resource for myself to keep track of my decisions-made-while-dissertating. Much easier to sift through to review, add to as I go, and keep it all contained.
