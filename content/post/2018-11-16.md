# blogdown

> **Matthew Grainger** (@Ed_pheasant; 11/1): Inspired by @cantabile I have made (am in the process of making) an academic website using #Blogdown. It was surprisingly easy*. (*If you ignore the three failed attempts to get it to launch and the problems getting RStudio and GitHub talk to each other politely)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1063072771809468416)

> **Lisa DeBruine üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà** (@lisadebruine; 2/0): @djnavarro @lingtax It's a lovely site! I have really patchy luck with blogdown and usually end up just doing simple flat sites with rmarkdown (for things that don't need a database).

> **Danielle Navarro** (@djnavarro; 2/0): @lingtax Yes, I have much to teach about how to break blogdown sites by making terrible terrible choices. üí£üå™Ô∏èüë©‚Äçüíª‚ö°üî•  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1063053236578353152)

> **kernüêæpanik** (@kernpanik; 1/0): I just installed @xieyihui's #blogdown, planning to use it to replace my #Jekyll site. So far, it looks pretty straightforward and works like a charm.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1063100106902306816)

# bookdown

> **Eleanor Chodroff** (@echodroff; 8/0): Someone recommended that I add a PDF version of my Corpus Phonetics Tutorial to arXiv, so after several hours trying to figure out how to go from bookdown-html to tex-pdf, I finally did.

# knitr

> **Will Landau** (@wmlandau; 5/0): @frod_san @BenBondLamberty @jdblischak And by reproducibility (when it comes to drake) I mean synchronizing results with the underlying code and data, skipping steps that are already up to date. The attitude toward reproducibility in workflowr is closer to that of knitr and R Markdown.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1063096066671894528)

When I first start ed, for the life of me, I simply could not figure out how to get a one of my data sets to work with Knitr...days of frustration.
