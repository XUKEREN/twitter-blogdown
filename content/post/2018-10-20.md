# blogdown

> **clark rushing** (@clarkrushing; 13/0): Been messing around w #blogdown to create a personal website for a while but felt like it wasn't ready to publish. However,  T&amp;P committee recently told me I need more web presence. Still a work in progress but find out more about my lab here https://t.co/StliNoZBZM #newPI  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1053383081053237248)

> **David John Baker** (@DavidJohnBaker; 4/1): This is a bit out of left field, but I've been using @RStudio to write my dissertation (playing around with @xieyihui's bookdown) + have been loving it. One thing I weirdly like is having the 130 character margin on. It helps reign in verbose sentences #AcWri #phdchat  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1053244539241160704)

> **David John Baker** (@DavidJohnBaker; 2/0): I probably will blog about it all at some point when I have chapter drafts ready to go, but I'll bet $20 using RMarkdown + Bookdown will be the future for all academic projects. Using this really encourages clean project management and clear, transparent research practices.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1053244540826607617)

> **Hannah Maier** (@hannahemaier; 0/0): I'm still working my way through many resources (thanks, all!), but one thing I wish I learned earlier is to use R projects!  And RELATIVE paths using the project folder as the root directory.  #rstats

# knitr

> **Shravan Vasishth** (@shravanvasishth; 1/0): I feel like I'm being punished for being an early adopter of reproducible code. All my Sweave files going back to 2008-11 have to be converted to knitr Rnw. This is easy. But Rnw to Rmd is going to be hard work.
