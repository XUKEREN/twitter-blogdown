> **J.B. Shaw** (@RefocusOpen; 0/0): @ACLjohn ACLjohn, Worldwide, there are several more (20+) popular platforms for open digital eBooks/textbooks. For example, Baja eBooks (34,000+ free eBooks in Spanish) @ https://t.co/651tFVTu4G  And there are more specialty platforms too, like BooKDown @ https://t.co/9QJiKLdvWT Enjoy ;-)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1051174038259654656)

> **Solomon Kurz** (@SolomonKurz; 0/0): @PStrafo Finally got around to checking out your tip. I like it and now formally introduce it in section 4.3.4. with an explicit reference to your tweet https://t.co/fQYSOC8BbZ. Right now, it just lives on GitHub, but it’ll make it into the project’s next #bookdown update, too.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1051123853743837184)

# knitr

> **Javier Sajuria** (@jsajuria; 2/0): @maibennett texted? stargazer? Move to RStudio and write in RMarkdown? Knitr?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1051157718076219392)

> **Elio Campitelli** (@d_olivaw; 0/0): Another #knitr trick. Put this on your setup chunk and every document's cache folder will be inside a another folder called "cache". Keeps your file structure cleaner. #rstats https://t.co/OFcx8DrXUb  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1051260415831887873)
