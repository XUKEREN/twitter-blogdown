> **Sabah Ul-Hasan** (@sabahzero; 1/0): @Hao_and_Y I've really been going back and forth on blogdown. Is there an advantage besides it being in R for those already familiar with it? I feel like a lot of R is still a bit clunky for some of the visuals I'd like to do but also new to it so maybe "impatient" is a better adjective.

> **Andrew Heiss, PhD** (@andrewheiss; 0/0): @kearneymw But the weird thing is that this never happened in any of my blogdown sites last fall and spring, and they all use _index. Maybe something changed in blogdown? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1039774545572294658)

# knitr

> **annakrystalli** (@annakrystalli; 2/0): @CMastication @nj_tierney In Rmd, I might occassionally present code that lives in .R scripts but import them with knitr::read_chunk. That's way I only have one copy of the code to curate but can present inner workings of a workflow if required.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1039757307134001153)

> **Suzan Baert** (@SuzanBaert; 0/0): @ma_salmon @fusionet24 @hrbrmstr I was just wondering about this yesterday: i wanted to make all my material in xaringan but that means that every time I knit i send out the same API calls. Any fix except for temporary eval=FALSE ?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1039778060676026368)

Rmd is good enough for technical writing &amp; reproducible document. And it would be more perfect if RStudio support other language‚Äôs kernel in its console.
