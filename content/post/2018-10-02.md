When adding an image using the bookdown ‚ÄúInsert image‚Äù addin, I can‚Äôt see the image in the RStudio Viewer. 
Is there something wrong or will the image show up once the website is deployed online?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1046866773411340289)

# knitr

> **baptiste** (@baptiste_auguie; 1/0): @rOpenSci @kivikakk @opencpu @ma_salmon ... one advantage being a more robust handling of inline code, which is currently extracted by regexs in knitr. Having the full structured AST before running code chunks also allows greater flexibility for pre- and post-processing with custom markup, etc.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1046845661537132544)

> **baptiste** (@baptiste_auguie; 1/0): @rOpenSci @kivikakk @opencpu @ma_salmon and in fact, i believe that with such a toolchain an alternative to knitr would process chunks once they've been parsed into xml, and update the AST with the results. (i suggested this a while back, but as Yihui said this wasn't possible with pandoc back when knitr started)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1046844131102715904)

> **John Minter** (@jrminter; 0/0): @Arabian_Analyst If you can install R packages, you should look into TinyTeX by yihui xie. It installs a minimal TeX install (and you can add other packages) into your user space. See https://t.co/LJJVGeerVA
Maybe that will work for you.
Best wishes,
