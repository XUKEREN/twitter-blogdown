# blogdown

> **Elise Gould** (@EliseGould; 1/0): @cantabile Thanks for the heads up! I‚Äôve observed similar behaviour In my blogdown-hugo notebook and .bib files. I‚Äôll be sure they‚Äôre adequately spaced at the end of the doc once I get my radix blog conversion happening!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1065179515935027201)

I wish there was a tutorial for @Zoneedit and @Netlify and they played nicely together, but it's #trialanderror trying to get SSL working.  I forgot this was a thing. #ThanksgivingEve #blogdown #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1065285689107980294)

(who is finishing up her PhD if you are looking for someone who can do microbiome analyses in an uber-reproducible fashion using bookdown, so you should absolutely hire her!)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1065165172069752832)

# knitr

> **Damien C-C** (@dccc_phd; 1/0): @martinjhnhadley A hybrid option would be to use code externalization (https://t.co/G9LVH5qGTY), where the first section ("setup_env") of your 'data-processing.R' loads the necessary packages and is then called as one of the first chunks in your Markdown document.

> **Paul Sochacki** (@Cyberskout99; 0/0): Several innovative #workarounds have been provided herein https://t.co/DSTOA5WSp3 and it looks like I will want to systematically evaluate each option to decide on the best one for the use case I'm working with.  This might need to be revisited as my code grows more complex.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1065407124233048064)

> **Paul Sochacki** (@Cyberskout99; 0/0): Naturally, there is a cryptic #error that displayed on the first run.  I followed the very well-written, quite possibly simplest tutorial I could find to generate a basic PDF document (https://t.co/4VX7YZC0DA).  Now the real #treasurehunt begins.

# xaringan

  janitor::get_dupes()
  xaringan:::inf_mr()
  rlist::list.filter()
  match.arg() 
  readr's parse_number() and parse_time()
  match.arg()

üì¶ xaringan - @xieyihui provided phonetics, but I'm still not sure
