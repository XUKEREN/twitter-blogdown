> **Danielle Navarro** (@djnavarro; 3/0): @statsgen @emilyandthelime Right? Iâ€™d mostly given up hope of ever porting it to bookdown or seeing a tidyverse adaptation - Iâ€™ve just run out of steam on that project - but there it is! I actually cried a little with happiness just seeing it ðŸ™‚  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1078732784590512128)

> **Ranae Dietzel** (@RanaeDietzel; 0/0): @JonathanEStarr That is weird. Do you want to knit to a pdf book with bookdown? It is a little more complicated than other .rmds.

> **Jonathan Starr** (@JonathanEStarr; 0/0): @RanaeDietzel I stumbled on your thread for knitting R4DS.  When I click on the knit button in R-Studio, it knits to HTML.  How do I get it to knit to PDF?  Do I have to change the YAML header part "knit: "bookdown::render_book"?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1078691351024283649)
