# blogdown

> **Ilja** (@fubits; 7/0): So in conclusion, @xieyihui‚Äòs #blogdown resonates very well with everyone! Lot‚Äôs of üòÆ faces after we launched a website with 3 lines of code üòà. Even Pythonistas want to convert now.

> **Elizabeth Morin-Lessard** (@emorinlessard; 3/1): I've been wanting to revamp my personal academic website and came across this awesome "tweetorial" by @dsquintana. Websites can be created for free using the blogdown R package. Bonus: Changes can be visualized as you tweak the code in @rstudio. I'm sold! #AcademicTwitter https://t.co/HZPUrbzb5L  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1068668568504459264)

> **Jacquie Tran** (@jacquietran; 0/0): @StatsbyLopez Hi Michael, your blogdown site looks great! I'm wondering whether there is an easy way to access your older blog posts? When I click on the 'More Posts' link from the home page, I get a blank page: https://t.co/5JfjT0FoBj  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1068610306379702272)

I'm really liking hugo academic/blogdown so far. A bit of a learning curve (I knew no markdown or yaml, still don't really...). But seems like it will be really useful for sharing work.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1068514308819116035)

# knitr

> **Jeremy Kahn** (@trochee; 4/0): @VerbingNouns @joshraclaw R is probably the "language" best described as a collection of "jacquards" "cross-stitch" "recipes" or "knitting patterns" and I think that says interesting things about knitr.

> **Cristina** (@biologeek; 0/0): @hadleywickham Any hack to use {roxygen2} for homeless scripts like Doxygen does for C*? Can't seem to find anything for scripts outside of packages. knitr::spin() has been brought up but it doesn't work quite the same.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1068643610508361728)

# xaringan

> **Danielle Navarro** (@djnavarro; 53/3): I don't know what I'm more pleased with - the fact that I *finally* forced myself to start working on this horrible horrible tutorial, or that I managed to learn the basics of @statsgen's magnificent kunoichi theme for xaringan! üòç https://t.co/qGJl6T2f7O  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1068584428010491904)

> **Peter Hickey** (@PeteHaitch; 11/6): @LinYingxin is presenting scMerge, her second talk this week after her great presentation at #abacbs2018! She's switched from powerpoint to #xaringan for more #rstats street cred at #BioCAsia üòé  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1068355332403949568)

> **Danielle Navarro** (@djnavarro; 2/0): @MarKubsch @bmwiernik I hate it so much I'm thinking of teaching myself xaringan as an avoidance mechanism  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1068406232690524161)

<!-- -->


> **Emi Tanaka üåæ** (@statsgen; 1/0): @djnavarro @EmmanuelPothos It might help if you use xaringan::inf_mr() which gives sort of a live preview if you are not using it already. I always use it when developing my slides  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1068693912317964288)
