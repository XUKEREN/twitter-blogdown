> **JD Long** (@CMastication; 29/2): This weekend I experimented with Hugo https://t.co/OiIsIcq9rD for static website generation. It took me a bit to grok what's going on, but when I saw the continuous integration with @Netlify and github, I was all: 💻🕸️😍 Blogdown with #rstats is my holiday project...

> **Emily Robinson** (@robinson_es; 16/0): Made possible by (finally) moving my blog to blogdown, as code on my old version didn't display well. Looking forward to writing more code-heavy posts now that it's a lot easier!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1064576878860804097)

I have a question: https://t.co/MRJTzcODV9  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1064397158076473344)

> **Emily Robinson** (@robinson_es; 5/0): @xieyihui Yeah, not sure if I want to enable it, so just commented out the code. Thanks!

Also, thanks to you, Amber, and Alison for the blogdown book! Was very helpful and where I got theme. And I followed the advice to just cut and past the posts :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1064594543209791494)

> **Jeff Hollister** (@jhollist; 1/0): @CMastication @Netlify Switched https://t.co/xP9FUdDKug a while back.  Was using Jekyll prior to that.  Blogdown was a big upgrade for me.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1064552549993377792)

> **John Cassil** (@johncassil; 0/0): @robinson_es I dream of creating a personal blogdown website, but I don't have incredibly interesting content to fill it with at the moment because all of my analyses tend to be confidential to my employer. https://t.co/hpLi1ydnG0  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1064686445670162434)

> **JD Long** (@CMastication; 1/0): @karlstanley @Netlify I wasn't really motivated to learn much until I decided that I might need a new site and I thought "I keep hearing about how magical Hugo is" ... plus the integration with R through the package bookdown is pretty nifty. That's really what nudged me to Hugo...  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1064555088545497089)

> **Joshua Goldberg** (@GoldbergData; 1/0): @flaviocopes @ossia @freeCodeCamp Awesome work! How did you compile the book? May I suggest converting to bookdown (@xieyihui). Bookdown then supports many other versions of your choice. Authors who have used bookdown have made it easy to manage edits since the book is hosted on a version control backbone.

> **Edward Visel** (@alistaire; 0/0): @chrisalbon bookdown takes this idea to 11, and is a particularly good option if code is involved  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1064383700626862080)

# knitr

> **James Goldie** (@rensa_co; 2/0): @sellorm @carroll_jono @rstudio It didn't occur to me that custom knitr engines could be used for stuff like embedding data directly! That is ~~wild~~  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1064667354011824128)

> **Amandeep Jutla** (@AmandeepJutla; 0/0): Just spent half an hour trying to figure out why my simple one-liner Rprofile wasn't loading, only to find out that R will just SILENTLY IGNORE your one-liner if it isn't followed by a newline. Nothing like R to get your day off to a murderous start. https://t.co/F4VfdUtY9q  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1064489420827570176)
