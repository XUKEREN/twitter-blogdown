> **Adam Gruer** (@AdamGruer; 0/0): @jdblischak I‚Äôm open to all ideas. Copying to temp was the only way I could come up with to keep all the action in the rstudio viewer. I‚Äôve been reading through the source code of blogdown and servr to see if Yihui does it differently but struggling to understand it so far.

> **Christophe Dervieux** (@chrisderv; 1/0): @apreshill @PipingHotData @minebocek Yes self-contained is not a good option here but 1 html file is not the only offline option. If you have everything in a local folder, especially remark.js, no issue. look at https://t.co/tzKQC1jg68 the tricky part is mathjax if you have equation. You'll need to ‚¨áÔ∏è locally too.

# xaringan

> **Emily Riederer** (@EmilyRiederer; 10/0): @PipingHotData @minebocek @apreshill If you‚Äôre having trouble with xaringan, storyboards in flexdashboqrd can also make pretty nice presentations depending on the type of content / message you are trying to convey https://t.co/IC3moe01v0  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1073001289339027456)

You need to make sure you download the relevant js and fonts beforehand though. So if you can get to that stage, in theory it should be okay if you copy the folder over!
