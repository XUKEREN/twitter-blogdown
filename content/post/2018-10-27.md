> **Shawn Graham** (@electricarchaeo; 0/0): so ODATE is using a .bib file with bookdown from which citations are generated when the thing is rendered. But not all appropriate fields are making it into the rendered volume. bibliostyle is set in yml as `apalike` but I wonder where on earth I edit that...

# knitr

> **Melissa K Sharp** (@sharpmelk; 3/0): #rmarkdown is a wonderful glorious thing. #knitr is amazing. #reproducible research ftw @rstatstweet I love you. #happyfriday everyone #phdlife https://t.co/JdcgnZoQko  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1055864778361655302)

> **Eric Leung** (@erictleung; 1/0): @apreshill @WatanabeSmith @rudeboybert @JennyBryan I also share @WatanabeSmith's feeling as well. I think the disconnect for me comes from "Especially if you use R Markdown and knitr, which trips up alot of people with its default behavior of 'working directory = directory where this file lives'." https://t.co/rduMn1H4b7  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1055883827040542720)

> **Ian Durbach** (@indurbach; 3/0): R markdown files are no longer rendered as markdown on Github. I liked this feature but good reasons to change too ü§î https://t.co/Bnv1EyNNvb  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1055739830540238848)

> **Jonathan Nolis** (@skyetetra; 0/0): @marskar I haven't tried it honestly. I look at Jupyter notebooks and it seems like R Markdown files are a strictly superior experience. I think the file paradigm makes a lot more sense and leads to fewer errors (see https://t.co/thqagc1HwZ)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1056021969844334592)
