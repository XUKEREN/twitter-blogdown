> **Yisu Zhou** (@makzhou; 0/0): side note: I switched to #xaringan this semester (tried reveal-md once, couldn't really keep up with the development) from #latex . I think being tied to #rstudio really helps people like me who couldn't really manage so many pkgs under the hood. One installation and good to go.
