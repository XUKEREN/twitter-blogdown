> **Shannon Ellis** (@Shannon_E_Ellis; 1/0): @MattOldach @jtleek Hi there!  The previous website was created in the last lesson in the Introduction to R course; however, it did not use #blogdown. It generated an RMarkdown website. Thanks for the feedback! I'm going to edit the lesson to clarify this.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1051828869626568705)
