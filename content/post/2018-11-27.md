# blogdown

> **Shila Ghazanfar** (@shazanfar; 11/4): #COMBINE18 panellists just highlighted the importance of communicating your research interests for cultivating your presence e.g. writing a blog. Building blogs are becoming muuch easier with tools like blogdown and helpful tutorials like @statsgen 's https://t.co/akb6rfdtbo  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1066924387528392704)

# bookdown

> **Lindsay Lee** (@lindsayevanslee; 11/1): Do any #rstats people have any advice about how to effectively version control a bookdown book translated into multiple languages (e.g. English and Spanish)? beyond just like, having two files and being careful to always make the same edits to both...

> **Hugo Gruson** (@grusonh; 0/0): @lindsayevanslee Does @transifex or any similar alternative work with bookdown? That could be an option. Many people use it for collaborative translations but I guess it would work even if you do it yourself.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1067128381651779584)
