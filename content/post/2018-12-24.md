> **Romain François 🦄** (@romain_francois; 8/0): I should definitely do more of these #blogdown version of talks, ideally before giving the talk.

> **Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 2/1): @romain_francois @dvaughan32 It was introduced last December https://t.co/Ti2Js9GZRE so needs to be better integrated in blogdown docs/demo site  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1076861585086328833)

> **Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 2/0): @dvaughan32 @romain_francois I desperately want working with images in blogdown to be easier, that and relative links to other blog sections. In my last class, the majority of commits were students losing it over how to embed an image. Page bundles do help!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1076861346874970117)

# bookdown

> **Lisa DeBruine 🏳️‍🌈** (@lisadebruine; 3/0): @nmmichalak I just followed the tutorial at https://t.co/F11eV5eCFv and it took an afternoon. The main difficulty was editing my old rmarkdown site into the right format for blogdown. I think it would be easier to just start fresh.

I feel I have been saying this about once a week to different people: https://t.co/oimSJTHTtH The answer to your question is buried in Section 2.5 of the blogdown book. I can tell you the direct answer, but you may want to learn how to fish instead :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1076350514789580801)
