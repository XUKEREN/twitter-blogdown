> **Visualizing the League** (@VisualizingTheL; 1/0): @scottyla1 I'm stoked to try giving this a go with blogdown. Also, kudos to the @rstudio people on a name that really hits the sweet spot of semantic legibility and grotesque nerdery  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1048288542013644801)

Any help I can borrow, please... https://t.co/CoRw9wqJQ1  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1048187234162102273)

# xaringan

> **Daniel Anderson** (@datalorax_; 13/3): Almost asked the amazing @statsgen a #xarinagan CSS question but decided to post to @StackOverflow first (https://t.co/zpMnMWy8q3). Guess who answered?! The #rstats community comes through again! Thanks Emi!!!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1048199896132595713)

> **Emi Tanaka 🌾** (@statsgen; 3/0): @datalorax_ @StackOverflow I was wondering the same question as you only a few days ago so it's great it's on SO now! @xieyihui may have already noticed but xaringan is on my SO watch list so high chance I'll answer it if I know the answer😁  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1048316785810800640)

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 2/0): @privefl @RLesur For the record, this was the commit in the dev version that fixed this issue: https://t.co/8j2AlX9Ynq (which is essentially what you did in your gist)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1048228444717371393)
